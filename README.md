Workflow is a Maven Discord Bot written in Java and made with the [JDA wrapper](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA). It uses a JSON database to save projects, tasks and teams to help make project planning more convenient inside of Discord. Workflow can help make your work more efficient and organised, all in Discord!
